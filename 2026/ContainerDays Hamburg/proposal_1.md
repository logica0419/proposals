### ❔ In Evaluation

## Description

Memory management is crucial for Go performance, but most sessions have been overly complex. If you're new to memory management or have struggled to learn it, this session is for you.
A solid understanding of memory management helps tackle performance challenges. Yet, past conference sessions are often difficult for learners because they dive straight into technical details like heap escaping and allocation logic, focusing on how they work. But before tackling the "how," it's essential to learn what those functionalities are and why they were developed.
Heap, stack, and garbage collection—memory management concepts have evolved to solve data management challenges in programming languages. By exploring their motivations, you'll gain a deeper understanding of memory management and the confidence to engage in Go memory management discussions.
Let's unravel the chronicle of memory management and build a strong foundation for mastering advanced Go memory concepts.
