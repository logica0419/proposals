# Mastering Config Management Tools in Argo CD: Extending Manifest Generation

## Status

### ‚ùì On Evaluation

## Description

Discover how mastering config management tools and CMP in Argo CD can boost productivity and empower meaningful contributions to open-source projects!

Inside Argo CD, the argocd-repo-server manages the source and generates raw Kubernetes manifests, which define the desired state of an application.  
This process, known as config management, is a cornerstone of GitOps workflows.

Understanding config management is crucial for debugging complex application states and improving deployment efficiency.  
This session explores config management tools natively integrated into Argo CD, such as Kustomize and Helm, providing insights into their implementation.  
It also highlights opportunities for contribution, illustrated by the speaker's enhancements to Helm in Argo CD.

The talk also introduces Argo CD's Configuration Management Plugins. Attendees will learn best practices for designing and implementing CMP, with practical insights from the speaker's experience developing a Helmfile CMP.

## Benefits to the ecosystem

Understanding how config management tools are integrated is fundamental for Argo CD users but is often overlooked by beginners.  
This session fills that gap by providing a foundational understanding of manifest generation in Argo CD, helping attendees better debug complex application states.

Attendees will learn how Argo CD uses config management tools like Kustomize and Helm to define the desired state of applications.  
The session will also highlight opportunities for contribution to Argo projects, using the speaker's work enhancing Helm in Argo CD as a concrete example.

Additionally, introducing Configuration Management Plugins (CMP) will show how Argo CD can be extended to integrate third-party tools, enriching the ecosystem and enabling more flexible deployments.  
This session encourages active participation in improving config management, benefiting the Argo and Kubernetes communities.
