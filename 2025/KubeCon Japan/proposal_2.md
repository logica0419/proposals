# Shikinen Sengu of the Platform: Rebuilding a Small Cloud with "Dependency Inversion"

## Status

### ‚ùì On Evaluation

## Description

Nekko Cloud is an experimental small-scale private cloud developed within a CS student community. It consists of members' home labs connected via VPN.

Currently, the platform combines Proxmox for IaaS with a Kubernetes cluster for PaaS.  
However, given the small size of our community, dual virtualization (VM and container) imposes a massive management and educational burden. Challenges like complex observability also limit usability.

To address these issues, we propose "dependency inversion," shifting from traditional "PaaS on IaaS" to "IaaS on PaaS" using ecosystem tools like KubeVirt. By establishing bare-metal Kubernetes as the backbone of all cloud functionalities, we simplify the architecture, eliminate redundancy, and optimize for small-scale private cloud needs.  
This ongoing project is called "Nekko Cloud Gen.2."

Discover how Nekko Cloud Gen.2 with "dependency inversion" redefines small-scale cloud design, solving inefficiencies and enhancing usability!

## Benefits to the ecosystem

This presentation offers a paradigm shift in cloud architecture, specifically for small-scale private clouds.  

While some previous experiments have explored placing IaaS on Kubernetes, they are typically executed on large platforms, so the benefits are relatively small. In contrast, Nekko Cloud Gen.2 demonstrates how "dependency inversion" can streamline small-scale cloud design by eliminating inefficiencies and redundancy.  
This approach is valuable for a small management team environment where traditional cloud models are inefficient or unnecessarily complex. Focusing on small-scale private clouds, this project introduces a scalable, resource-efficient model that reduces the overhead of managing large virtualized environments. It provides practical insights for developers and communities working with constrained resources, offering solutions that are easy to implement, effective, and tailored to specific use cases.

Ultimately, Nekko Cloud Gen.2 demonstrates how to build a lightweight cloud platform that enhances sustainability and accessibility, making cloud computing more efficient for small, resource-constrained environments. We will share our accomplishments on GitHub so that others facing similar challenges can benefit from our experience.
