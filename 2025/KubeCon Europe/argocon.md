# Mastering Config Management: Exploring and Extending Manifest Generation

## Status

### ‚ùì On Evaluation

## Description

Inside Argo CD, the argocd-repo-server manages the source repository and generates raw Kubernetes manifests, which define the desired state of an application.  
This process, known as config management, is a cornerstone of GitOps workflows.

Understanding config management is crucial for debugging complex application states and improving deployment efficiency.  
This session explores "native" tools like Kustomize and Helm, offering insights into their implementation.  
It also highlights opportunities for contribution, illustrated by the speaker's enhancements to Helm in Argo CD.

The talk also introduces Configuration Management Plugins (CMP), the Argo CD extension to integrate third-party tools.  
Attendees will learn best practices for designing and implementing CMP, with practical insights from the speaker's experience developing a Helmfile CMP.

Discover how mastering config management and CMP can enhance productivity and foster meaningful contributions to open-source projects!
